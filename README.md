Welcome to my personal corner of the internet!  
This repository hosts the code for my portfolio website, showcasing my projects, skills, and a little bit about who I am.

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a curious soul exploring the world of computer science, dancing in the rain, and dreaming of AGI-powered genetic revolutions.  
Technology both inspires and scares me — and that's what makes it magical.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

This project is built with:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.

---

## 🚀 Deployment

This portfolio is deployed using **Netlify**.

- **Build Command**: `npm run build` _(or)_ `yarn build`
- **Publish Directory**: `build`
- **Client-side Routing**: A `_redirects` file is included in the `public` directory to handle client-side routing on Netlify, ensuring that direct URL access to sub-pages works correctly.
